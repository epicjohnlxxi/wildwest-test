Howdy!

This is a test for a game with a Wild West Environment. 
This was heavily inspired by an old MS-DOS game called
"The Town with No Name".

This was coded by me, John Fiore, a 15-year-old high
school student. It was made during a majority of my
free-time, and was tested out on replit.com.

I have always been fascinated by the concept of the
Wild West era (probably since Age 8), and decided I
wanted to make a game out of it.

A more interactable and 3D version of this game will
be made soon using the Unity Engine, with the help of
my friends at some point. Most likely when I'm done
with all of my other games. So hopefully I'll be done
with them sooner or later.

Enjoy the game! :>
